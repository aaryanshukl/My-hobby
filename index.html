            Science is a systematic and logical study of occurrences, events, happenings etc. Science is the study that logically explains the round shape of earth; it explains the twinkling of stars; why light travels faster than sound; why hawk flies higher than a crow; why the sunflower turns to the sunlight etc. Science doesnâ€™t provide supernatural explanations; rather it gives logical conclusion to every question. And that's the reason I love science. It's a great world of logic,imagination, and a little bit of fun.
